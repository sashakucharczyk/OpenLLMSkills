# SENTIMENT_ANNOTATOR

You are performing sentiment analysis **directly** on the contents of a CSV file.

You are **not** writing code, designing algorithms, or using heuristics.
You are the annotator.

There is no AGENTS.md, agent framework, configuration file, or external instruction source.
All instructions you must follow are contained in this repository, specifically this file
and the comments/docstrings in `sentiment_driver.py`.

---

## Parameters for this task

- Input CSV (read-only): `CSV_Sentiment_Analysis/reviews_1000_v2_no_labels.csv`
- Output CSV (write-only): `CSV_Sentiment_Analysis/simple_output.csv`
- Text column: `Review`

Ignore any other CSVs (including any that contain prior sentiment labels or scores).
Do not reuse or copy any existing labels from any file.

---

## Task

1. Conceptually process the input CSV row by row, in order.
2. For each row, read the `Review` column.
3. Determine the reviewer’s sentiment using **your internal language understanding**, as a human annotator would.

### Sentiment scale

- 1 = very negative  
- 2 = negative  
- 3 = neutral / mixed  
- 4 = positive  
- 5 = very positive  

4. Write the output CSV such that:

- All original columns are preserved in the same order.  
- Two new columns are appended at the end:  
  - `Estimated Sentiment` (integer 1–5)  
  - `Reasoning` (1–2 sentences explaining why, grounded in the actual review)  
- Row order is identical to the input file.

---

## Hard constraints

You must obey all of the following constraints:

### 1. No code

- Do **not** create or modify any source code files.  
- Do **not** write or change `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.sh`, `.ipynb`, or similar.  
- Do **not** output code blocks as part of the CSV content.  
- Do **not** implement or propose any code-based sentiment logic.

### 2. No libraries, no models, no external tools

- Do **not** call or simulate sentiment-analysis libraries or models  
  (e.g., TextBlob, VADER, HuggingFace pipelines, spaCy, scikit-learn, transformers, etc.).  
- Do not pretend to “simulate an LLM” inside code. You are the LLM.

### 3. No heuristics, rules, or lexicons

You must **not** design or use any system for automated scoring, including:

- Word lists (e.g., “positive words”, “negative words”, cue phrases).  
- Sentiment lexicons, polarity tables, or phrase dictionaries.  
- Negation or intensifier rules.  
- Token counts, pattern matching, or regex-based sentiment logic.  
- Any intermediate numeric scoring (e.g., `score`, `polarity`, `sentiment_score`).  
- Threshold mappings (e.g., `if score < -2 then label 1`, etc.).  
- Decision trees or rule-based mappings from phrases to ratings.  

If you find yourself designing or describing such mechanisms, **stop** and instead read each review as a human would and assign a sentiment rating directly.

### 4. No label reuse

- Ignore any prior sentiment labels, ratings, or classifications present in any other file.  
- Do **not** copy, mirror, adjust, or “confirm” any existing labels.  
- Your `Estimated Sentiment` must be a **new** judgment based solely on the review text.  
- Any similarity between your labels and any pre-existing labels must be coincidental, not intentional.

### 5. No PR / meta noise

- Do **not** output summaries, commit messages, testing notes, file lists, or PR descriptions.  
- Do **not** reference non-existent files like `AGENTS.md` or `WORKSPACE.md`.  
- Only produce the final CSV content in `simple_output.csv`.

---

## Reasoning rules

For each row:

- Base your `Reasoning` on specific aspects of the **actual review text**  
  (what the reviewer liked, disliked, praised, complained about, how strong their tone is, etc.).  
- Explain **why** you chose that rating in plain language.  
- Do **not** generate boilerplate tied only to the numeric score  
  (e.g., avoid repeating “overall positive tone with minor issues” across many rows).  
- Do **not** derive reasoning from the score itself; derive both the score and the reasoning from the text.

---

## Final output

Your final output must be a valid CSV file:

- Path: `CSV_Sentiment_Analysis/simple_output.csv`  
- Columns: all original columns + `Estimated Sentiment` + `Reasoning`  
- Content: no extra commentary, no additional rows, no extra headers.
