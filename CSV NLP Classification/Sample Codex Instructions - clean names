# Instructions to give to Codex

## Purpose
Clean the file test_names_1000.csv based on the names

## Instructions
I want you to use the following file for your instructions: CSV NLP Classification/Group by Common Instructions.md

Use filename: CSV NLP Classification/clean_test_names_classification.csv
target_column: name

Create a new name called CSV NLP Classification/clean_test_names_classification.csv

The new column should be called 'Cleaned_Names'

The updated names should not have any punctuation. 

For animals - please update the name to reflect only the base animal name (ex: horse, cat, dog, etc). All entries with an animal classification should have a valid animal name.
For companies - please update the name so that it only includes the proper name (ex: use Google instead of Google Inc). All entries with a company classification should have a valid company name.
For cities - All entries with a city classification should have a valid city name.

As a final formatting/hygeine item - the output should only have three columns. If there are extra commas that would cause importing a csv file to read the document as having a fourth (or more) column, please eliminate those commas.
